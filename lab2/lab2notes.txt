calculate noise by calculations derivitave of log funciton for each pixel then multiplied by epsilon
 devide epsilon values by 256 to make them valid because the pixels are scaled
	compute gradient of correct class label (loss), you want to increase the distance from that label
 
 FGSM does one perterbation
 
 To defend add perterbed images to training data
	iterate through every test image, and run FGSM to get a perterbed dataset and add the perterbed ones as well
